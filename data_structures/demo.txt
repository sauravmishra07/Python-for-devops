On one hand, India’s democratic system has enabled regular elections, peaceful transfers of power, and representation for a highly diverse population, while economic reforms and welfare programs have helped lift millions out of poverty. On the other hand, persistent issues such as inequality, regional disparities, bureaucratic inefficiency, and social polarization continue to test governance and social cohesion.
